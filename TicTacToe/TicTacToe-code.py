#   Welcome to TicTacToe
#   This is a two player game where the players take turns in setting their symbol in 1 of the 9 availabe fields
#   Each player gets to choose the Symbol they want to use. Whoever gets to have 3 of his symbols in a row first, wins.
#   This is also the first code that I wrote completley on my own
#   I hope you enjoy!
